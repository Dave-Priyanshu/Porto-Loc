fix(about): Prevent services warning reappearing after acknowledging and saving 6+ services

- Replaced `scrollToWrapper` with `scrollToWarning` in `updateCheckboxes` to fix scrolling to services warning.
- Corrected drag-and-drop event listeners in `setupDragAndDropServices` to use `servicesWrapper`.
- Added `servicesWarningAcknowledged` flag in `localStorage` to persist warning acknowledgment.
- Updated `updateCheckboxes` to show warning only when reaching 6 services if not previously acknowledged.
- Modified form submission to set/reset `servicesWarningAcknowledged` based on service count.

-- profile page --
1. Location Autocomplete with Geolocation
Explanation: Enhance the location field with an autocomplete dropdown powered by a geolocation API (e.g., Google Places API or OpenStreetMap Nominatim) and an option to use the browser’s geolocation to prefill the user’s city/country. This simplifies input and ensures accurate location formatting format.


3.Collapsible Help Tips for Each Field - at the end

    Explanation: Add expandable help icons (e.g., question mark icons) next to each field label that reveal tips or examples when clicked. This guides users without cluttering the form interface.

4. Gamification with Profile Completion Badges

    Explanation: Introduce badges or progress indicators for completing profile fields (e.g., “Profile Pro” for filling all fields, “Resume Rockstar” for uploading a resume). This motivates users to fully complete their profile.
5. Keyboard Navigation Enhancements

    Explanation: Improve keyboard accessibility by ensuring all interactive elements (inputs, buttons, file uploads) are focusable and navigable with clear visual focus indicators. This makes the form more inclusive for users relying on keyboards or screen readers.

6. Voice Input for Text Fields

    Explanation: Allow users to input text (e.g., name, job title, location) using voice recognition via the Web Speech API. This caters to users with motor disabilities or those who prefer hands-free input, enhancing accessibility.
7. Multi-Language Support for Form Labels
Explanation: Allow users to switch the form’s language (e.g., English, Spanish, French) for labels, placeholders, and help text. This supports non-English-speaking users and enhances global usability.

    Description: Implement an interactive tour (using a library like Intro.js) guiding new users through each section’s features (e.g., "Click here to add a skill") with skippable steps.

Thank you for the feedback! I understand the issues:

    Sign Up Form Positioning on Mobile: When clicking the "Sign Up" button in mobile view, the Sign Up form appears on the right side of the screen, requiring horizontal scrolling. Instead, it should appear directly below the mobile toggle buttons, just like the Sign In form.
    Add Animation for Form Toggling: When switching between the Sign In and Sign Up forms in mobile view, we need to add a smooth animation to enhance the user experience.

Let’s address these issues by updating the auth.blade.php file. Here’s the plan:
Plan to Resolve Issues

    Fix Sign Up Form Positioning:
        The issue arises because the desktop layout uses a sliding animation (transform: translateX(100%)) to switch between forms, which is still affecting the mobile view. In mobile view, we’re using display: block/none to toggle forms, but residual desktop styles (e.g., transform) are causing the Sign Up form to appear off-screen.
        Solution: Ensure that in mobile view, the transform property is reset, and both forms are positioned directly below the toggle buttons using position: relative and proper layout adjustments.
    Add Animation for Form Toggling:
        We’ll add a fade-and-slide animation when switching between forms in mobile view. This can be achieved using CSS transitions with opacity and a slight vertical translateY for a smooth effect.
        Solution: Add a CSS animation that fades out the current form and fades in the new form with a subtle slide-up effect.

Updated auth.blade.php

Below is the updated auth.blade.php file with the fixes for form positioning and the addition of a toggle animation in mobile view. I’ve kept the rest of the functionality intact, focusing on the mobile-specific changes.

1. this is a landing page of my porfolio project, where user can create thier amazing portfolios with simple step, what i want to do is i want to tell user a story in the landing page meaning it should look like a story.
- hello my self priyanshu Dave, i'm laravel developer and learning new concepts of laravel by creating projects is what i do
- One day i was updating my portfolio and though that this doc files and pdf's are not best friends updating portfolio is a pain in the as.. umm nevermind, that's why i thoufgh i should create a site in which i can create and share my portfolio with ease thats why i created this,
- but as i was creating this project for myself and it's really a dumb idea to generate a whole site just for myself, right?than i thought that unlike me there could be bunch of lazy/busy people that also feels same as i feel about upating a peace of paper which gives them food. at that moment the idea of buildmyfolio came into my mind and i crated this beautiful and easy to use site.

i have seen many portfolio creation sites where user has to drag and drop elemetns that they want to add and half of them are paid so user has to pay a lot i mean a lot(time,money,sweat and only creative people are able to create something amazing and trust me i'm not one of them, like i'm but i'm not as well) just to generate a document which they can create for free in google doc. but this is really a pain in the as.. umm nevermind,One day i was updating my portfolio and though that this document files and pdf's are not best friends, that's why i thought that i should create something, something really creative so i started createing portoflio using html.....yeah html. thats a really great way to start by the way. than i thought ok so whenever i have to make some changes i have to add another div and add bunch of css just to make one goddam experiance fit in the screen. and that's exactly what we have to do in the document as well right? so both the ways are kind of similar, in one you should have some kind of coding knowlegde or you have to be really good at writing promtps in chat gpt. soo that's when i though that i need a dashboard from which i can add data and that data get's converted into a portfolio site. umm good idea priyanshu but how exactly are you thinking to do that?? boom... the born of BuildMyFolio. yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy woohoooooo.. here user can add directly add data update it and delete it as well from a really good mobile responsive user panel and share the link of the portfolio directly to anyone on planet earth or mars if you are really good friends with aliens and you need a great job opportunities there,
but as i was creating this project for myself and it's really a dumb idea to generate a whole site just for myself, right?than i thought that unlike me there could be bunch of lazy/busy people that also feels same as i feel about upating a peace of paper which gives them food. at that moment the idea of buildmyfolio came into my mind and i crated this beautiful and easy to use site.
